Skilled at managing complex projects involving a mix of public agencies and private stakeholders, Patricia Boozang advises clients on the implementation of coverage, delivery system and payment reforms across government and private health insurance programs. Her clients include federal agencies, foundations, states, healthcare delivery systems and health plans.

Patricia advises states on Medicaid expansion design, implementation and sustainability, and has particular experience in alternative expansion models through 1115 waivers. For Arkansas, she helped develop and implement the state’s groundbreaking private option initiative and its successor program, Arkansas Works.

Patricia also guides states and marketplaces on policy matters, including eligibility and enrollment, benefit design, delivery system improvements, and technology development. For Minnesota, she led Manatt Health’s work to facilitate and provide subject matter knowledge to the Minnesota Health Care Financing Task Force, established in statute to make recommendations regarding the future of the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace and coverage programs including Medicaid.

As a technical assistance advisor in the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s State Health and Value Strategies program, Patricia counsels states on a wide range of healthcare coverage policy matters, including those related to the ACA, 1115 and 1332 waivers, and federal repeal-and-replace proposals.

Drawing on her wealth of experience in Medicaid managed care and other delivery system reforms, Patricia regularly advises health systems on Medicaid accountable care organization development and other delivery system transformations. She advises the Coalition of New York State Public Health Plans, an association of eight managed care plans that serves more than 2 million beneficiaries of that state’s public health insurance programs.

A frequent writer on health insurance laws and systems, particularly as they relate to managed care, Patricia also advises clients on government mandates covering insurance affordability and eligibility as well as insurance business processes.

Prior to joining Manatt in 2000, Patricia was a vice president and leadership team member of Physician Weblink, a national healthcare technology and physician management company. Earlier, she worked at Sterling Health Capital Management Inc., assisting hospitals and community health centers in business planning and implementation.
